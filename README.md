## My process
I started the Design on Small Devices Starting with 375px width then I started climb up
The Problem I faced was that in Large screens which is around (992px) The Card was very Large
That There was scrolling I tackled this problem for quite a time to find a good workaround
and at the end I sit max-width property and it override the min-width I sit which was quite
the solution.
